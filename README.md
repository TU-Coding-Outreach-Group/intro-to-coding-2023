# Intro to Coding Bootcamp 2023
## Coding Outreach Group (COG)


This set of tutorials is intended for complete beginners to coding. If you have never written a line of code in your life, these tutorials will help you get compfortable coding in three programming languages: bash, python, and R. These three language are often used by psychology researchers, and these tutorials are catered to that field. However, the concepts covered are applicable in any field that does coding. Much of the material covered in the tutorials is borrowed from some already great, and more in-depth tutorials. A list of these is available [here](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/Tutorials/blob/master/index.md).

## Getting Started
Each tutorial will list the necessary pre-requisites in their respective README.md files, but here is some software we recommend you install before the workshops. We will also spend some time going over installation on Day 1.
- A command-line shell (i.e. Bash, see note below)
- A text editor you're comfortable with (Atom, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), etc.)
- Spyder, available through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- Git and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (Optional)

For PC users, you can set up the bash command line and git by installing [this program](https://gitforwindows.org/). For apple or linux OS users, your terminal is this and you do not need to install further software.


## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the Psychology and Neuroscience Department at Temple University, and especially Dr. Peter Marshall for their support.
